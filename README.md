Scripts & utilities to generate Seamaps for Garmin plotters

The directories "mkgmap", "splitter" & "osmosis" have to be populated with, or contain links to,
the utilites with those names. mkgmap & splitter are avaialable from http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/
and osmosis is avaialble from http://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-latest.zip

Then the process can be started using "mkoseam.sh".
